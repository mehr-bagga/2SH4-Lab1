	// 	1. Given an array and its size, visit every single element in the array up to size-2 (i.e. up to the second last element, omit the last element)
	//  2. For every visited element (current element), check its subsequent element (next element).  
	//     If the next element is smaller, swap the current element and the next element. 
	//  3. Continue until reaching size-2 element.  This is considered One Pass => increment pass count by one.
	//  4. Repeat 1-3 until encountering a pass in which no swapping was done.
	//   -> Sorting Completed.
